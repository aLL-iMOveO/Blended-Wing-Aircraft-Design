# Blended-Wing-Aircraft-Design
To sketch a blended wing aircraft using Python, you will need to use a graphics library that can create 2D or 3D shapes and render them to a window or image file. Some options for Python graphics libraries include Matplotlib, Pygame, and PyOpenGL
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Set up the figure and axes
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Set the axis limits to match the size of the aircraft
ax.set_xlim(-10, 10)
ax.set_ylim(-5, 15)

# Draw the main body of the aircraft using a series of connected lines
body_x = [-5, 5, 5, -5, -5]
body_y = [0, 0, 10, 10, 0]
ax.plot(body_x, body_y, color='black')

# Draw the wing using a series of connected lines
wing_x = [-10, -5, 0, 5, 10]
wing_y = [0, 2, 5, 2, 0]
ax.plot(wing_x, wing_y, color='black')

# Display the figure
plt.show()
This will create a window with a simple outline of the blended wing aircraft. You can customize the appearance of the aircraft by adjusting the coordinates of the lines and using different colors, line styles, and other visual properties.

To create a more complex 3D model of the aircraft, you may need to use a more powerful graphics library like PyOpenGL, which can handle 3D shapes, lighting, and other advanced graphics features.![4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63648217/210184094-0ad57c86-6a8d-456e-8f33-b542fe6d4ecd.jpg)
